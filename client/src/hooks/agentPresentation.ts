 * those surfaces:
 *
 *   - `active`, `idle`  — always pass through
 *   - `completed`       — pass through only when `showCompleted` is true
 *   - `error`, `waiting`— always blocked here (no other layer re-introduces them)
 *
 * Downstream consumers may apply additional local hiding (e.g. the Phaser
 * scene drops heroes whose last event is older than its idle threshold),
 * but they MUST NOT re-introduce a status this function blocked.
