> **Use Claude Code CLI or Codex as usual — each agent session auto-spawns a hero on the dashboard, live.**

Agent Quest is a browser-based monitoring dashboard that visualizes active Claude Code and Codex agent sessions as fantasy heroes in a 2D village. Each running agent becomes a hero who walks between buildings based on what it's doing: `Read` sends it to the Library, `Edit` to the Forge, `Bash` to the Arena, and so on.

## Why?

Claude Code and Codex sessions happen in a terminal — useful, but not very *alive*. When you run several agents at once (across projects, across `~/.claude*` installations and `~/.codex`), it's hard to feel what they're actually doing. Agent Quest turns that invisible activity into something you can glance at: a little village where every hero is an agent, and where they walk tells you what they're up to.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of active Claude Code and Codex sessions
- Auto-discovery of every `~/.claude*` directory (supports multiple installations like `~/.claude-work`, `~/.claude-personale`) and of `~/.codex` if present
- Activity feed, party bar, and detail panel alongside the village scene
- Built-in map editor for customizing the village layout
- Sub-second latency: `fs.watch` event-driven updates over native WebSocket, with a safety-net poll fallback for events the watch misses

## Requirements

**Required**
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.1 or later — the runtime behind both the server and the scripts. If you don't have it: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
- An active Claude Code or Codex installation (one or more `~/.claude*` directories, and/or `~/.codex`, with session logs). Without either, the dashboard still starts, but the village stays empty and a banner tells you so.
- See the [Platform matrix](#platform-matrix) below for OS support per provider.

**Optional**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20+ with npm — only if you prefer the `npm run …` command form. If you only have Bun installed, every `npm run X` in this README has an equivalent `bun run X`.

## Quick start

Agent Quest can be set up in **two equivalent ways** — pick the one that matches your platform:

- **Manual install (classic)** — `git clone` + `bun install` + `bun start`. Three commands, full control, works everywhere (macOS, Linux, Windows via WSL2).
- **One-line install (macOS only)** — a single `curl | bash` that installs Bun if missing, clones the repo, installs dependencies, creates a global `agentquest` command, and launches the app.

They do the same work under the hood. Every daily command has an equivalent:

| With the CLI        | Without (classic)                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `agentquest`        | `bun start`                            |
| `agentquest update` | `git pull --ff-only && bun install`    |

`agentquest update` is a convenience command for end users running an installed copy that tracks `origin/main`. It is not the contributor workflow for feature branches.

### Manual install

Three commands — works on macOS, Linux, and Windows via WSL2:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FulAppiOS/Agent-Quest.git
cd Agent-Quest
bun install
bun start
```

That's it: your browser opens on <http://localhost:4445> and the village appears.

Optional — create an `agentquest` shortcut so you can launch from any directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s "$PWD/bin/agentquest" ~/.local/bin/agentquest
```

After the symlink you can run `agentquest` (alias of `bun start`) and `agentquest update` (alias of `git pull --ff-only && bun install`) from anywhere.

Agent Quest ships with a bundled CC0 pixel-art sprite pack (under `client/public/assets/themes/tiny-swords-cc0/`), so there's nothing else to download.

### One-line install (macOS only)

*The one-line installer script is macOS-only; Agent Quest itself runs on macOS and Linux, and via WSL2 on Windows — see the manual install above.*

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FulAppiOS/Agent-Quest/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer prints exactly what it's going to do and asks before touching anything. It checks/installs Bun, clones into `~/agent-quest` (override with `--dir <path>`), runs `bun install`, creates an `agentquest` shortcut in `~/.local/bin/`, and offers to launch right away. When it finishes, your browser opens on <http://localhost:4445> and the village appears.

From the next session onwards:

```bash
agentquest            # same as `agentquest start` — launches and opens the browser
agentquest update     # git pull + bun install (preserves local map edits)
```

## Troubleshooting

**`bun: command not found`** — install Bun first, then re-run the Quick start:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

**`Cannot find module …` on startup** — dependencies weren't installed. From the repo root:

```bash
bun install
```

**`EADDRINUSE` on port 4444 or 4445** — another process holds the port. Either free it or override the port via env (see [Configuration](#configuration)). To see what is holding it and kill it:

```bash
lsof -ti:4444,4445 | xargs kill -9
```

**`agentquest: command not found` after install** — `~/.local/bin` is not in your `$PATH`. Add it:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

**Empty village with a "No Claude Code or Codex installation detected" banner** — expected when no `~/.claude*` or `~/.codex` directory with session logs exists. Start a Claude Code or Codex session and heroes appear automatically (the banner disappears on its own).

**Assets look broken or the app blocks at boot with "missing asset" screens** — see [Missing assets](#missing-assets).

## Configuration

Defaults work out of the box. To customize ports or URLs, copy the example env files:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
cp client/.env.example client/.env
```

| Variable | Where | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | server | `4444` | HTTP + WebSocket port |
| `CLIENT_URL` | server | `http://localhost:4445` | CORS origin |
| `CLIENT_PORT` | client | `4445` | Vite dev server port |
| `VITE_SERVER_URL` | client | `http://localhost:4444` | Server HTTP base |
| `VITE_WS_URL` | client | `ws://localhost:4444/ws` | Server WebSocket URL |

## Development

```bash
npm start              # server + client concurrently   (or: bun start)
npm run dev:server     # server only (:4444)            (or: bun run dev:server)
npm run dev:client     # client only (:4445)            (or: bun run dev:client)
npm run check:assets   # verify every bundled sprite is on disk (or: bun run check:assets)
cd server && bun test  # run server tests
```

For installed end-user copies that follow `main`, `agentquest update` runs the equivalent of `git pull --ff-only && bun install` while preserving local map edits. Contributors on feature branches should use normal Git commands instead.

### Missing assets

If you accidentally delete or move files under `client/public/assets/themes/tiny-swords-cc0/` (hero spritesheets, building PNGs, terrain, decorations), Agent Quest will tell you:

- The **main app** blocks at boot with a screen that lists the missing files grouped by category (hero / building / terrain / decoration) and suggests a restore command.
- The **map editor** shows a dismissible banner at the top with the same breakdown — the editor stays usable so you can keep working.
- Run `bun run check:assets` any time to verify the whole bundled pack ahead of starting the app. Exits non-zero with a detailed list if anything is missing — good for CI or pre-commit.

Restore with:

```bash
git checkout -- client/public/assets/themes/tiny-swords-cc0/
```

## LAN access (view from your phone / iPad)

By default the dev servers only listen on `localhost` for security. To share the village with other devices on the same Wi-Fi (phone, tablet, another laptop), opt in with a single env flag:

```bash
# macOS / Linux — one-off, for this run only
AGENT_QUEST_LAN=1 agentquest          # (or: AGENT_QUEST_LAN=1 bun start)

# Permanent — decide once, then just run `agentquest`
echo "AGENT_QUEST_LAN=1" >> ~/agent-quest/server/.env
echo "AGENT_QUEST_LAN=1" >> ~/agent-quest/client/.env
agentquest
```

Any env var documented in this README works identically with `agentquest` — just prefix it on the command line, or add it to the two `.env` files for a persistent choice.

At startup the server prints reachable LAN URLs, for example:

```
[Server] LAN mode enabled — reachable from other devices at:
[Server]   http://192.168.1.42:4444 (API)  |  http://192.168.1.42:4445 (UI)
```

Open the UI URL on the other device. The client auto-detects the host so API and WebSocket calls go to the same Mac. The first time, macOS asks to allow incoming connections — click **Allow**.

> **Security note.** LAN mode exposes your agents' tool calls, file paths and command output to anyone on the same network. Fine at home; think twice on office / café / conference Wi-Fi.

## Platform matrix

|             | macOS | Windows              | Linux |
|-------------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| Claude Code | ✓     | ✓ (WSL2 recommended) | ✓     |
| Codex       | ✓     | not yet verified     | not yet verified |

Claude Code is exercised on macOS and Windows (via WSL2). Codex has been tested on macOS only so far — it should work on Windows/Linux the same way (the provider watches `~/.codex/sessions/`), but we haven't confirmed it yet.

## Windows

Bun officially supports Windows (1.1+), but we don't exercise this project on native Windows and a few dev-tool edge cases exist (file watching under certain paths, spawn semantics). For a frictionless experience on Windows, run Agent Quest inside **WSL2**:

1. Install WSL2 following [Microsoft's guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (one command: `wsl --install` in an admin PowerShell).
2. Open your WSL2 shell (Ubuntu by default) and install Bun:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```

3. Follow the [Manual install](#manual-install) steps above, inside the WSL2 shell. The one-line installer is macOS-only.

Native Windows (PowerShell / cmd.exe) should also work after this project's cross-platform shell fixes, but isn't routinely tested. If you hit a Windows-only issue, please open a ticket — pull requests welcome.
